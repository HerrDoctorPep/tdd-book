# To do

* [Insert open items]

# Done

* Don't save bank items for every request

* Code smell: POST test too long

* Display multiple items in table

* Remove time.sleeps

* Clean up after FT runs

* Adjust model so that items are associated with different lists

* Add a url for creating a new list via POST

* Adjust unique urls for each lists

* Add urls for adding new item to existing list via POST

* Refactor code, esp. duplication in urls.py



# Remember...

## Database issue

Check why adding item 'in the wild' leads to error, while FT passes?!
